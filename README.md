Project Overview
This Git repository houses our React Native project, which leverages the power of Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) to simplify data fetching, caching, and state management in a React Native application. RTK Query eliminates the need for writing and maintaining complex data fetching logic, making our project more efficient and maintainable.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm installed on your system.
React Native CLI installed.
An emulator or physical device for testing the application.
A basic understanding of Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query).
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-native-rtk-query-project.git
Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd react-native-boilerplate
Install project dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

android: Contains Android-specific project files.
ios: Contains iOS-specific project files.
src: The heart of the project containing React components, RTK Query slices, screens, and other app-related code.
package.json: Lists project dependencies and scripts.
.gitignore: Excludes files and directories from version control.
Running the App
To start the application on your local development environment, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the React Native development server, which you can access via Expo or by scanning the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.

For running on specific platforms:

iOS: npm run ios
Android: npm run android
RTK Query
RTK Query slices for data fetching and state management are located in the slices directory. Be sure to review the official RTK Query documentation to understand how to define and use slices effectively in our project.

Development Guidelines
Adhere to coding conventions and style guides established in the project.
Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Write clean, well-documented code.
Create meaningful commit messages.
Follow Git flow and use feature branches.
